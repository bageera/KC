	 	 	I'm a creative enthusiast with a penchant for exploring the vast realm of multimedia. From the intricate world of Web and Graphic Design to the captivating fields of Videography and Photography, I immerse myself in the artistry of Animation and Drawing.
<br>
My versatile skill set extends to providing a range of services, including Company Branding, Consulting, and Video Editing. Behind the complexity of my work lies a simple man with a profound love for family, friends, life, and the sheer joy of transforming ideas into tangible creations.
<br>
As a freelance Graphic/Web Designer since 2002, I've been on a continuous journey of creative exploration, delving into every facet of multimedia that sparks my curiosity. Currently on the verge of completing my B.A. in Multimedia Design and Development at Devry University, I am driven by a relentless passion for learning and pushing the boundaries of my creative potential.
<br>
In the midst of my myriad projects, there's one that holds a special place in my heart a 3D animation film inspired by the boundless imagination of my sons. This project, infused with love and creativity, epitomizes my dedication to turning imagination into reality.
<br>
Every project I undertake is not just a job; it's a canvas where I blend simplicity with intricate ideas, creating a tapestry of multimedia experiences. I invite you to join me on this vibrant journey of creativity and innovation.
